Instructions to import data files from Github to Colab notebook:
Import the datasets in your Google Drive from Github and make all of them shareable. In the shared link for each file, there will be a unique ID which you need to copy and paste in the notebook as value to the 'id' key.
P.S. - Use Chrome browser to work on this project. You can download the Test data file only in Chrome as it doesn't work in other browsers.
